// Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar, the date and time 12/21/33 12:21, and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal – Panama".

// My solution
function isPalindrome(x) {
    const cleanString = x.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, '').toLowerCase();
    return cleanString === cleanString.split('').reverse().join('');
  }
